tagline: Automated External Channel Funding
description: >-
  This server leverages Pay-to-Endpoint to negotiate channel funding on your lightning node from an external wallet supporting BIP78.
  Previously, external funding could only be done by signing PSBTs manually.
  A node running this software can open a new scheduled lightning channel upon payment receipt from e.g.
  BTCPayServer with a normal QR scan transfer flow.
releaseNotes: >-
  ⚠️ WARNING: ULTRA-EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE

  ❗️ This project is pre-alpha quality and lacks basic checks. It is NOT fully BIP78-compliant ❗️

  Any unexpecected node setup or message will likely cause permanent loss of funds.

  For the love of god, do NOT use it on mainnet just yet! If you don't want to wait long, help with reviews and PRs
